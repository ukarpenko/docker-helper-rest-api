# ðŸ“Œ Managing Script Execution in Docker Containers

## ðŸŽ¯ Description

This project provides an application with a REST API that allows you to execute custom scripts in any running Docker container **without restarting them**.

The scripts will be executed **inside the container** as a **secondary process**.

Scripts are stored in the **client directory** (**[TODO]**: in the future, store them in S3).

The project is intended to serve as an initial **prototype** for the development of [k8s-helper-rest-api](https://github.com/ukarpenko/k8s-helper-rest-api) and is currently under active development.

### Key Components:

1. **FastAPI**:

   * API handler for receiving requests to run scripts. The API will accept a command to execute a script inside a container.
   * Each request will be mapped to the container where the script should be executed.

2. **Docker Interaction Service**:

   * The `docker exec` command will be used to execute scripts in containers.
   * The example code will use the `docker-py` library, which allows you to execute commands inside a container as if you were using `docker exec` manually.

3. **docker-compose**:

   * Containers will be managed by `docker-compose`, and the commands will be executed within these containers.

### How It Will Work:

* **The API receives a request** to execute a script.
* **The API selects the container** in which the script will be executed (e.g., through the container ID passed in the request).
* **The API executes the `docker exec` command** to run the script inside the container using the `docker-py` library.
* **The API returns the result** of the script execution to the client (including logs or execution errors).

## Future Architecture:

### Architectural Approach:

1. **Using a Container Cluster**:

   * You have several containers (e.g., 3) deployed using `docker-compose`.
   * Containers will run the main processes, while scripts will be executed in these containers concurrently via `docker exec`.

2. **API for Script Execution**:

   * FastAPI will receive requests from the client and then send commands to the containers through `docker exec` to run the scripts.
   * The request will specify in which container the script should be executed.

3. **Script Execution Logic**:

   * When a request to execute a script arrives, the server selects one of the containers and runs the script via the `docker exec` command.
   * The execution result will be returned to the client via the API.

4. **Access to Containers**:

   * Under development
